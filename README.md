## Project Description

Migration is an important aspect of cellular behaviour and is therefore widely studied in cell biology. Numerous components are known to participate in this process in a highly dynamic manner. In order to obtain a better insight in cell migration, mutants or drugs are used and their motive phenotype is then linked with the disturbing factors. One of the typical approaches to study motion paths of individual cells relies on fitting mean square displacements to a persistent random walk function. Since the numerous calculations involved often rely on diverse commercial software packages, the analysis can be expensive, labour-intensive and error-prone work. Additionally, due to the nature of algorithms employed the calculations involved are not readily reproducible without access to the exact software package(s) used.

For these reasons, the cell-motility package was developed to support convenient, free cell motion path analysis.

## Usage
Simply unzip (this will automatically create a new folder), enter the newly created folder, and double-click the cell-motility-x.y.z.jar file. That's all!

### Troubleshooting
If the application does not boot when you double-click it, try dropping to a command line, navigate to the cell-motility folder, and issue the following command `java -jar cell-motility-x.y.z.jar`. That should boot the application. If not, you probably do not have Java 1.5 or above installed. Please install Java first (which is freely available at http://www.java.com).
